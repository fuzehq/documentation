# Postman collection
We also have an up-to-date Postman collection containing all the API requests. A few things to keep in mind while using the Postman collection:
- You would need to replace the dummy apiKey and apiSecret.
- Be extra cautious while executing POST/PUT/DELETE APIs; they can permanently alter the states.
